- Open main01.py. Before running it, what do you expect this program to do?
It will display "Greetings!" on the next line. It displays "What is my favorite color?" on the following line, and whatever is entered will be the input. 

  - Now right click on the main1.py window and select “Run Python File in Terminal”. Click in the bottom panel, and answer the question. Describe what happened.
Greetings!
What is my favorite color?

  - What do you think the program did with what you typed in answer to the question? 
It saved it as an input substitute
  
- Open main02.py. Before running it, describe how this is different than main01.py.

  - What do you think the color = input() will do?
  - Run the program in the terminal and answer the question. Did the program do what you expected?
- Open main03.py. Before running it, describe how this is different than main02.py.
  - What is happening on lines 9–12?
  - Why are lines 10 and 12 indented?
  - Run the program and answer the question. What happens if you don’t capitalize Red?
  - What does this tell you about "color"?
- Open main04.py. Before running it, describe how this is different than main03.py.
  - What problem is this trying to solve?
  - Run the program and answer the question. What happens if you use some other capitalization scheme (i.e., “RED” or “reD“)?
- Open main05.py. What do you expect line 9 to do?
  - What problem is it trying to solve?
  - Run the program and answer the question. What happens if you add spaces before or after the word (i.e., “ RED “ or “ red”)?
 - Open main06.py. How is line 9 different than in main05.py?
   - What would you guess .strip() is doing?
   - Run the program and answer the question. Is there another way of writing “red” that will break this logic?
 - Open main07.py. Before running this program, how do you expect this to be different than main06.py?
   - What is happening on line 12?
   - Run the program and answer the question.
 - Open main08.py. What is the purpose of line 9?
   - Why are lines 10–17 indented?
   - Run the program. What would happen if line 10 were moved before line 9 (and no longer indented)?
   - Make that change and run the program again. (To end any Python program, you can type ctrl-c)
 - Open main09.py. What is happening on line 13?
   - What is the purpose of “count”?
   - What is happening on line 22?
   - Run the program.
 - *Extra credit:* open main10.py. Add a comment to each line describing what it is doing (a comment follows a pound sign [#]).
